# Field Trip Registration
For this exercise, we were to pretent to be a kindergarten teacher who is trying to determine which students still need to register for an upcoming field trip. This data is available in a JSON file with an array of student objects, with each object having the students' names and whether they're registered.

## Objective

* Use JavaScript to fetch data from a JSON file with an array of student "objects" to determine which students still needed to register for a field trip.
